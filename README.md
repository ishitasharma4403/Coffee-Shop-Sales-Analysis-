# Tools & Frameworks Used
This project leverages Excel’s Pivot Tables and Slicers to dynamically filter data by day, month, product category, and store location, enabling easy exploration of sales patterns across different dimensions. Data visualizations like pie charts, bar graphs, and line charts illustrate insights on product distribution, order sizes, and hourly trends. An interactive dashboard integrates these visual elements with key metrics, such as the average bill per person (4.69) and average orders per person (1.44), to present a complete, user-friendly overview of performance.
